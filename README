I wrote an XBT to DDS converter a while back, and I started working on figuring
out how the XBG format works. I figured it would be a lot more useful if I were
to just open source the entire project and put it out there for people to use
or build upon. I'm not particularly proud of this code (I think I even found
some hungarian notation in there, yuck), but it's better than just having the
code gather dust in some corner of my hard drive. If you know how any of the
other Far Cry 2 file formats work, let me know and I can try to implement a 
converteror or just fork this project and write the converter yourself.
